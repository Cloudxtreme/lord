# Lord of the Red Dragon

This is an open source, web based refresh of the classic BBS door game called Legend of 
the Red Dragon.

We want to develop an engaging game platform that can be managed and extended by 
moderators and other developers. Just as the original game allowed modules to be built, 
our LORD game will be extendable via an API. We will also evaluate other platforms to 
plug into, such as facebook, ios and android apps.

The initial core game will resemble the original BBS door game to start, will grow as the 
community sees fit. The code repository can be forked from github, extended and then 
merged back into the trunk.
